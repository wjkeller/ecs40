// [HGM] Note: the bitmaps for Shogi promoted pieces are #included, but not referred to in the list bitmapBits.
//       The front-end would have to substitutes them for some listed pieces, in variant shogi.
//       It would also have to replace the Queen bitmap with that of the Lance.
//       The Japanese-style Shogi symbols for size 58 are not included at all. To have those
//       you would have to convert the WinBoard .bmp files in the shogibitmaps folder with convert.c
