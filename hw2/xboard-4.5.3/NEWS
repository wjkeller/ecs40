** Version 4.4.0 **

A new release of both XBoard and WinBoard is now available.  Version
4.4.0 includes many changes. It is the first major release of
xboard/winboard after a fork of the project after version 4.2.7. It
includes small changes made in the main line and changes made by a
fork of Alessandro Scotti and lots of changes made afterwards by
H.G. Muller (released as versions 4.3.x). This release represents a
unified version of all changes made after the fork. It includes many
new features and bugfixes.

You can get both XBoard and WinBoard from the Savannah
project pages:

https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/xboard/

If you find a bug, please report it in the bug tracker at
https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/xboard/ or by email to bug-xboard
(AT) gnu.org.


** Version 4.3.16 **

New command-line options
/niceEngines=N       for adjusting the priority of engine processes so they don't soak up all your system resources
/firstOptions="..."   Allows the setting of options that engines define through the feature option="..." commands
/secondOptions="..."
/firstLogo=filename.bmp  Displays the mentioned bitmap next to the clock (with H:W =1:2 aspect ratio) (WB only)
/secondLogo=filename.bmp
/autoLogo=false          get logo files automatically from engineDirectory\logo.bmp

General enhancements:
* New WB-protocol command: 'feature option="NAME -TYPE VALUE OTHER"', which engines can use to define options
* New WB-protocol command: 'option NAME VALUE' used to set value of engine-defned options.
* implements /delayAfterQuit and /delayBeforeQuit in XBoard, and uses SIGKILL to terminate rogue engine processes


** Version 4.3.15 **

New command-line options
/rewindIndex=N (for the new auto-increment mode of the loadGameIndex or loadPositionIndex in match mode)
/sameColorGames=N (for playing a match where the same player has white all the time)
/egtFormats="..." (for specifying where various end-game tables are installed on the computer)

New menu items
+ Time-odds factors can be set in the time-control dialog
+ Nr of CPUs for SMP engines can be set in the Options -> UCI dialog
+ Own-Book options can be switched from the Options -> UCI dialog
+ The ScoreIsAbs options can be set from the Options -> Engine dialog
+ New-Variant menu adds Superchess

General Enhancements:
* WinBoard engines can now also use the Polyglot opening book (implemented as general GUI book)
* New WB-protocol commands memory, cores and egtpath make interactive setting of these parameters
  possible on WB engines
* New Polyglot is available that relays the interactive setting of these parameters to UCI engines
* Match mode suports an auto-increment mode, so that all games or positions from a file can be played
* Draw claims with Kings and an arbitrary number of like Bishops (e.g. KBBKB) are accepted

The source tree in original xboard 4.2.7 format can now be compiled under Cygwin with the aid
of the cygwin.mak file in the ~/winboard/ subdirectory of the source releasy, after you put
the hep-file from an executabl distribution there. Maefiles for other compilers are not updated
since 4.2.7, as I do not have those compilers.


** Version 4.3.14 **

This relaese was not made by the GNU xboard team, but by H.G.Muller.
It mainly contains developments on WinBoard. Nevertheless, an attempt
has been started to back-port the enormous number of improvements that
have been made to WinBoard since the Linux and Windows developments branched
to xboard. This is reflected by the source tree now having the same format
as that of xboard 4.2.7, including all the xboard sources.

An enormous amount of work still has to be done to make the xboard version
fully equivalent to WinBoard, especially on user-interface side. As a modest
beginning, the xboard source files have been patched to allow their compilation
with the newer back-end files from WinBoard. To this end, the number of piece
types in xboard has been increased from 6 to 22, and the WinBoard bitmaps
have been converted to xboard source format (.bm) and are included in the
xboard bitmaps directory. Other quick patches include the coloring of the
board squares (for xiangqi and holdings), and some code in the user-move
handling to suppress all moves into or out of the area between board and
holdings in crazyhouse, and the treatment of king-captures-own-piece
as a possibly valid move (for FRC castling). This should make it possible
to run xboard with the new back-end files without too much inconvenience.

New xboard command-line options have been added to make the added back-end
features available. The include the new variants (as argument of the old
-variant option), -boardWidth, -boardHeight and -holdingsSize. Be sure
to call xboard with "-boardSize middling" or "-boardSize bulky" if you
want to play with fairy pieces, or xboard might crash due to unavailability
of bitmaps. Other added xboard options are:

ADJUDICATION OPTIONS:
-checkMates
-testClaims
-materialDraws
-trivialDraws
-ruleMoves
-repeatsToDraw
-adjudicateLossThreshold
-firstScoreAbsolute
-secondScoreAbsolute

TIME-CONTROL OPTIONS
-firstTimeOdds
-secondTimeOdds
-timeOddsMode
-firstNPS
-secondNPS

GENERAL OPTIONS
-matchPause
-engineDebugOutput
-userName
-pgnExtendedInfo
-pgnEventHeader
-hideThinkingFromHuman

This is all completely untested, but as the options merely switch on well-tested
code in the back-end, there should not be too many problems with them.
Bugs can be reported in the WinBoard forum.


** Version 4.3.14k **

Compared to version 4.3.13 described below, this version features

New command-line options:
/autoKibitz (for relaying the PV info of the engine to the ICS)
/userName="..." (for setting the name of the Human player, also as menu)
/engineDebugOutput=N (controlling the writing of engine output to debug file)
/firstNPS=N (for time management by node count or CPU time)
/secondNPS=N (likewise for the other engine)

New Menu items
+ Enter Username (same as /userName command-line option)
+ Save Diagram (for saving the Chessboard display as bitmap file)
+ Machine Both (not implemented yet, but menu item already provided)
+ New-Variant menu adds CRC, Janus and Berolina (the latter only with legality testing off!)
+ Any variant can be played from a shuffled opening setup

Bugfixes:
* Problems with switching the variant in ICS zippy mode solved
* In ICS observing mode game history is now fully accessible
* Moves are not fed to engine in zippy mode, when observing a game from a variant unknown to the engine
* a problem with loading PGN of FRC games with move disambiguation and initial castling rights was fixed.
* A bug in the clock display that made previous versions of WinBoard crash for tiny displays is fixed

General enhancements:
* variant name displayed in title bar in ICS mode, when not 'normal'
* when receiving a challenge in ICS zippy mode, it is checked if the engine supports the variant (/zippyVariants="..." can still be used to limit the allowed variants, and for protocol-1 engines is still the only thing to go on)
* when loading a game from a PGN file, WB automatically switches to the variant specified in the PGN tags
* when starting from a loaded position (using /loadPositionFile), this position will be used on subsequent 'New Game' commands as well (until we switch variant)

New is also that the source tree is now brought back in the original WinBoard 4.2.7 format, including
xboard source files. Note, however, that the xboard sources are from an older date, and I did not test
if they still compile together with the much newer backend sources. I did add code in xboard.c to recognize
the new command-line options I added since then, and in so far they are back-end options that should be enough
to make them work. This is completely untested, though; I did not even try to compile it. Last time anyone
built a working xboard.exe from this was at a stage where WinBoard did have adjustable board size, allowing
it to play Xiangqi. But no crazyhouse holdings yet.


** Version 4.3.13a **

This version of WinBoard_F fixes several bugs in 4.3.12, and also addse a few new features.
The new features include:
- some more fairy pieces, so that each side now has 22 piece types in stead of 17,
making most fairy pieces available in board size "petite" (next to "bulky" and "middling"),
making the ArchBishop and Chancellor, as well as one wildcard piece (the Lance) available in all
sizes from "petite" to "bulky".
- The FRC support is fully fixed, both in local and ICS mode.
- A mechanism is provided for safe draw claiming in cases where a 3-fold repetition woud occur only
  after your own move. In this case a draw will be awarded by WinBoard if the engine sends "offer draw"
  before making its move.
- Genuine draw offers are not passed on immediately to the opponent but held up to when the offerer announces
  its move.
- Variants FRC, Cylinder and Falcon are added to the "New Variant..." menu.
- Support for playing time-odds games is added. (Options /firstTimeOdds, /secondTimeOdds, /timeOddsMode)
- A mechanism is provided for attaching WinBoard options to the engine command, to create options that
follow the engine (e.g. time odds) in a tournament run under a tournament manager.
Bugfixes include:
- Shatranj in ICS mode (did not work at all before)
- Some draw adjudications (QRKR was mistaken for KRKR, and KBKB with like Bishops is now recognized)
- time info in the PGN is now correct

** Winboard_F.4.3.12 release notes

This WinBoard (beta-)version is derived from Allessandro Scotti's
Winboard_x, and supports the following new options, mainly in the area
of adjudication of engine-engine games, improved Crazyhouse support,
and allowing variants with non-conventional pieces and or board
sizes. (All option are shown here with their default values):

/variant=normal
This (already existing) option has been expanded with
several new variants, involving non-conventional pieces and deviating
board sizes. The board size is automatically adapted to the selected
variant, unless explicitly overruled (see below). The new variants are
(with default board size, files x ranks, in parentheses):

variant name    Game           board     description
knightmate    Knightmate        (8x8)  Variant where the King moves as a Knight, and vice versa
capablanca    Capablanca Chess (10x8)  Variant featuring Archbishop and Chancellor as new pieces
gothic        Gothic Chess     (10x8)  Same as Capablanca, with a more interesting opening position
courier       Courier Chess    (12x8)  a Medieval form that combines elements of Shatranj and modern Chess
shogi         Shogi             (9x9)  Japanese Chess
xiangqi       Xiangqi          (9x10)  Chinese Chess
fairy         Fairy Chess       (8x8)  Variant were you can use all pieces of other variants together

The variant can be set from the newly added "File -> New Variant..."
sub-menu.  Extra board files are indicated by the letters i, j, k, l,
... For boards with more than 9 ranks, the counting starts at zero!
More than 10 ranks is not tested and unlikely to work in the area of
PGN saving / reading. Non-FIDE pieces will be referred to in FENs and
PGN by letters that depend on the variant, and might collide with
piece designators in other variants. E.g. in Xiangqi 'C' is a Cannon,
in Capablanca Chess it is a Chancellor. Pieces that do not belong in a
variant cannot be addressed in FEN and PGN either, for as long as that
variant is selected, unless the letter assignment is overruled with
the aid of the /pieceToCharTable option. The variant is not saved in
the winboard.ini file; on start-up we always get variant "normal"
unless we use the command-line option, or have added the option to the
winboard.ini file manually (in which case it will disappear when this
file is overwritten by WinBoard saving its options).  WinBoard_F knows
the movement of all pieces occurring in Capablanca Chess (of which
FIDE Chess is a subset), Shatranj, Courier, Xiangqi and 9x9 Shogi, so
that these games can be played with legality testing enabled.

/pieceToCharTable="PNBRQFWEMOUHACGSKpnbrqfwemouhacgsk"
Each piece that WinBoard knows (in its legality test) has a letter
associated with it, by which it will be referred to in FEN or PGN. The
default assignment can be overruled with this option. The value has to
be a string of even length, with at least 12 characters. The first
half of the string designates the white pieces, the second half the
black.  The last letter for each color will be assigned to the
King. (This is the piece that moves as an orthodox King; note that
Nightmate and Xiangqi have a different royal piece.) All letters
before it will be assigned to the other pieces in the order:

P Pawn                 (move often depends on variant)
N Knight               (move subtly different in Xiangqi (where it is written as H) or Shogi)
B Bishop
R Rook
Q Queen                (Lance L in Shogi)
F Ferz/General         (The Shatranj 'Queen' and Xiangqi 'Adviser', used for Silver General S in Shogi.)
W Wazir/GrandVizer     (Gold General G in Shogi, in Xiangqi it is royal and denoted by K)
E Alfil/Elephant       (Moves subtly different in Xiangqi vs Shatranj/Courier)
M Commoner/Man
O Cannon/Pao
U Unicorn              (representation of Royal Knight in Knightmate, used as promoted Pawn in Shogi)
H Nightrider           (Promoted Knight in Shogi and CrazyHouse)
A Archbishop/Cardinal  (Promoted Bishop in Shogi and CrazyHouse)
C Chancellor/Marshall  (Promoted Rook   in Shogi and CrazyHouse)
G Grasshopper          (Promoted Queen in Crazyhouse, promoted Lance in Shogi)
S                      (Promoted Silver in Shogi)
K King

Pieces that are not mentioned (because the argument has less than 34
characters) will remain disabled. Mentioned pieces can be disabled by
assigning them a '.' (period). They are then not recognized in FEN or
PGN input. Non-FIDE pieces that are not assigned a letter will also
not appear on the promotion menu. It is not advisable to disable a
piece that is present in the opening position of the selected variant,
though.
Promoted pieces that need to be distinguished from original pieces of
the same type (because of demotion on capture and transfer to the
holdings) will be indicated by the letter for the unpromoted piece
with a '+' in front of it (Shogi), or by the letter of the promoted
piece with a '~' after it (Crazyhouse, Bughouse, in general everything
with holdings that is not Shogi). To achieve this, they should be
assigned the characters '+' or '~', respectively.
All the new pieces have a native bitmap representation in the board
sizes 'bulky' and 'middling'. For all window sizes that do not support
such fairy bitmaps, promoted NBRQ are represented as a 2-sizes-smaller
normal piece symbol, so that Crazyhouse can be played at any
size. People disliking the fairy representations might even prefer
this.
There is an enhanced 'Edit Position' menu popup (right-clicking on the
squares after selecting this mode in the main menu), featuring some
common non-FIDE pieces, and 'promote' and 'demote' options to make
those not directly in the menu. The promotion popup shows ArchBishop
and Chancellor in Capablanca and Gothic, (or in fact in any game where
this piece is not disabled or a promoted version of a normal piece),
and leaves only the options YES / NO in Shogi. In Xiangqi there are no
promotions.

/fontPieceToCharTable="PNBRQFWEMOUHACGSKpnbrqfwemouhacgsk"
This option is similar to /pieceToCharTable, but sets the font
character that is used to display the piece on the screen (when
font-based rendering is in use), rather than in the FEN or PGN. The
default setting should work with George Tsavdaris' WinboardF font,
which uses the 'intuitive' mapping of font characters to symbols. With
font-based rendering the fairy pieces can be used at any board size.
Note that UHACGS are also used to represent the promoted versions of
PNBRQF, in games like Crazyhouse and Shogi, where the promotion has to
be undone on capture. In such games you are likely to prefer a
different representation of those pieces then when they represent true
fairy pieces.

/flipBlack=FALSE
Traditional Shogi bitmaps are only included for size "moderate". For
other sizes you must depend on font-based rendering.

/detectMate=TRUE
/testClaim=TRUE
/materialDraws=TRUE
/trivialDraws=FALSE
/ruleMoves=51
/repeatsToDraw=6
The option /materialDraws=TRUE causes games with insufficient mating
material to be adjudicated immediately as draws, in case the engines
would not claim these draws. This applies to KK, KNK and KBK.  The
option /trivialDraws adjudicates KNNK, KBKB, KNKN, KBKN, KRKR and KQKQ
to draws after 3 moves (to allow for a quick tactical win). Note that
in KQKQ this might not be sound, but that problem would disappear once
bitbase probing is implemented.

Clocks
The flag-fell condition is now indicated as '(!)' behind the displayed
time, to eliminate the necessity for overwriting the message in the
title bar (which might contain indispensible information in match
mode).

Other improvements / changes
Castling rights and e.p. rights are now fully maintained, and
considered in legality testing. They are imported from and written to
FEN, as is the 50-move counter. (When reading an incomplete FEN they
are still guessed, though.)  The time (in sec, or min:sec) is now
always stored together with the PV information to the PGN, if storing
the latter was requested (through ticking "extended PGN info" in
"Options -> General..."). The saved time is the WinBoard clock time
(as opposed to the time reported by the engine).

** Winboard_F.4.3.8 release notes

This Winboard supports the following new options (shown here with their default values):

/variant=normal
This (already existing) option has been expanded with several new
variants, involving non-conventional pieces and deviating board
sizes. The board size is automatically adapted to the selected
variant, unless explicitly overruled (see below). The new variants are
(with default board size, files x ranks, in parentheses):

variant name    Game           board     description
knightmate    Knightmate        (8x8)  Variant where the King moves as a Knight, and vice versa
capablanca    Capablanca Chess (10x8)  Variant featuring Archbishop and Chancellor as new pieces
gothic        Gothic Chess     (10x8)  Same as Capablanca, with a more interesting opening position
courier       Courier Chess    (12x8)  a Medieval form that combines elements of Shatranj and modern Chess
shogi         Shogi             (9x9)  Japanese Chess
xiangqi       Xiangqi          (9x10)  Chinese Chess
fairy         Fairy Chess       (8x8)  Variant were you can use all pieces of other variants together

The variant can be set from the newly added "File -> New Variant..." sub-menu.
Extra board files are indicated by the letters i, j, k, l, ... For
boards with more than 9 ranks, the counting starts at zero! Non-FIDE
pieces will be referred to in FENs and PGN by letters that depend on
the variant, and might collide with piece designators in other
variants. E.g. in Xiangqi 'C' is a Cannon, in Capablanca Chess it is a
Chancellor. Pieces that do not belong in a variant cannot be addressed
in FEN and PGN either as long as that variant is selected, unless the
letter assignment is overruled by the /pieceToCharTable option. The
variant is not saved in the winboard.ini file; on start-up we always
get variant "normal" unless we use the command-line opton, or have
added the option to the winboard.ini file manually (in which case it
will disappear when this file is overwritten).  WinBoard_F knows the
movement of all pieces occurring in Capablanca Chess (of which FIDE
Chess is a subset), Shatranj, Courier, Xiangqi and 9x9 Shogi, so that
these games can be played with legality testing enabled.

/pieceToCharTable="PNBRQFWEMOUHACGSKpnbrqfwemouhacgsk"
Each piece that WinBoard knows (in its legality test) has a letter
associated with it, by which it will be referred to in FEN or PGN. The
default assignment can be overruled with this option. The value has to
be a string of even length, with at least 12 characters. The first
half of the string designates the white pieces, the second half the
black.  The last letter for each color will be assigned to the
King. (This is the piece that moves as an orthodox King; note that
Nightmate and Xiangqi have a different royal piece.) All letters
before it will be assigned to the other pieces in the order:

P Pawn                 (move often depends on variant)
N Knight               (move subtly different in Xiangqi (where it is written as H) or Shogi)
B Bishop
R Rook
Q Queen                (Lance L in Shogi)
F Ferz/General         (Silver General S in Shogi)
W Wazir/GrandVizer     (Gold General G in Shogi, in Xiangqi it is royal and denoted by K)
E Alfil/Elephant       (Moves subtly different in Xiangqi vs Shatranj/Courier)
M Commoner/Man
O Cannon/Pao
U Unicorn              (representation of Royal Knight in Knightmate, used as promoted Pawn in Shogi)
H Nightrider           (Promoted Knight in Shogi and CrazyHouse)
A Archbishop/Cardinal  (Promoted Bishop in Shogi and CrazyHouse)
C Chancellor/Marshall  (Promoted Rook   in Shogi and CrazyHouse)
G Grasshopper          (Promoted Queen in Crazyhouse, promoted Lance in Shogi)
S                      (Promoted Silver in Shogi)
K King

Pieces that are not mentioned (because the argument has less than 34
characters) will remain disabled. Mentioned pieces can be disabled by
assigning them a '.' (period). They are then not recognized in FEN or
PGN input. It is not advisable to disable a piece that is present in
the opening position of the selected variant, though.
Promoted pieces that need to be distinguished from original pieces of
the same type (because of demotion on capture and transfer to the
holdings) will be indicated by the letter for the unpromoted piece
with a '+' in front of it (Shogi), or by the letter of the promoted
piece with a '~' after it (Crazyhouse, Bughouse, in general everything
with holdings that is not Shogi).
All the new pieces have a native biytmap representation in the board
sizes 'bulky' and 'middling'. For all window sizes that do not support
such fairy bitmaps, promoted NBRQ are represented as a 2-sizes-smaller
normal piece symbol, so that Crazyhouse can be played at any
size. People disliking the fairy representations might even prefer
that.
There is an enhanced 'Edit Position' menu popup (right-clicking on the
squares after selecting this mode in the main menu), featuring some
common non-FIDE pieces, and 'promote' and 'demote' options to make
those not directly in the menu. The promotion popup shows ArchBishop
and Chancellor in Capablanca and Gothic, (or in fact in any game where
this piece is not disabled), and leaves only the options YES / NO in
Shogi. In Xiangqi there are no promotions.

/alphaRank=FALSE
This option does not seem to work for reading PGN files. Saving works
fine. For now, using it is not recommended. In the future it might be
redefined as only affecting engine-engine communication, .

/flipBlack=FALSE
Setting this option will cause upside-down display of the native piece
bitmaps used to represent the pieces of the side that plays black, as
would be needed for a traditional representation of Shogi pieces. It
can be set from the "Options -> Board..." sub-menu, and it is saved in
the winboard.ini file. For now, traditional Shogi bitmaps are not
included, though.

Other improvements / changes
Castling rights and e.p. rights are now fully maintained, and
considered in legality testing. They are imported from and written to
FEN, as is the 50-move counter. The time (in sec, or min:sec) is now

be a string of even length, with at least 12 characters. The first

with a '+' in front of it (Shogi), or by the letter of the promoted
piece with a '~' after it (Crazyhouse, Bughouse, in general everything
with holdings that is not Shogi).
All the new pieces have a native biytmap representation in the board
sizes 'bulky' and 'middling'. For all window sizes that do not support
such fairy bitmaps, promoted NBRQ are represented as a 2-sizes-smaller
normal piece symbol, so that Crazyhouse can be played at any
size. People disliking the fairy representations might even prefer
that.
There is an enhanced 'Edit Position' menu popup (right-clicking on the
squares after selecting this mode in the main menu), featuring some
common non-FIDE pieces, and 'promote' and 'demote' options to make
those not directly in the menu. The promotion popup shows ArchBishop
and Chancellor in Capablanca and Gothic, (or in fact in any game where
this piece is not disabled), and leaves only the options YES / NO in
Shogi. In Xiangqi there are no promotions.

/fontPieceToCharTable="PNBRQFWEMOUHACGSKpnbrqfwemouhacgsk"
This option is similar to /pieceToCharTable, but sets the font
character that is used to display the piece on the screen (when
font-based rendering is in use), rather than in the FEN or PGN. The
default setting should work with the WinboardF font, which uses the
'intuitive' mapping of font characters to symbols.  Note that UHACGS
are also used to represent the promoted versions of PNBRQF, in games
like Crazyhouse and Shogi, where the promotion has to be undone on
capture.

/boardWidth=-1 /boardHeight=-1
Set a number of files and ranks of the playing board to a value that
will override the defaults for the variant that is selected. A value
of -1 means the variant default board size will be used for the
corresponding parameter (and is itself the default value of these
options). These parameters can be set in the "Files -> New Variant..."
sub-menu, where they are reset to the default -1 is you OK the chosen
variant without typing something to overrule it. These parameters are
saved in the winboard.ini file. (But unless you saved while a variant
with board-size override was selected, they will always be saved as
-1.)
A variant with a non-standard board size will be communicated to the
engine(s) with the board size prefixed to the variant name,
e.g. "variant 12x8_capablanca". In protocol 2 the engine must first
enable this feature by sending "boardsizeFxR" amongst the accepted
variants, where F is the maximum number of files, and R the maximum
number of ranks, as decimal numbers.

/holdingsSize=-1
Set the size of the holdings for dropable pieces to a value that will
override the default for the variant that is selected. A value of -1
means the variant default holdings size will be used for that
parameter (and is itself the default value of this options). This
parameter can be set in the Files -> New Variant... sub-menu, where it
is reset to the default -1 is you OK the chosen variant without typing
something to overrule it. This parameters is saved in the winboard.ini
file.  To disable holdings, set their size to 0. They will then not be
displayed. For non-zero holding size N, the holdings are displayed
left and right of the board, and piece drops can be effected by
dragging pieces from the holdings to the drop square. In bughouse, the
holdings will be filled by the ICS. In all other variants, captured
pieces will go into the holdings (after reversing their color). Only
the first N pieces of the /pieceToCharTable argument will go into the
holdings. All other pieces will be converted to Pawns. (In Shogi,
however they will be demoted in the regular way before determining if
they fit.) Pieces that are disabled (per default and per
/pieceToCharTable option) might not be counted when determining what
are the first N pieces.  Non-standard holdingsize will be communicated
to the engine by prefixing it (together with the board size, even if
this is standard) to the variant name, e.g. "variant 7x7+5_shogi". In
protocol 2 the engine should enable this feature by sending
"holdingsH" amongst the variant names, where H is the maximum
acceptable holdings size as a decimal number.

/alphaRank=FALSE
When this parameter is true, a-h are converted to 1-9, and vice versa,
in all move output and input (to PGN files or SAN move display as well
as in communication with the engine). This might be useful for Shogi,
where conventionally one uses letters to designate ranks, and digits
to designate files. Engines that want to use this option must make
sure pieces are never represented by lower case! This option can be
set from the Files -> New Variant... menu, where it defaults to FALSE
unless you explicitly set it. It is not saved in the winboard.ini
file.  Note that the PGN format in Shogi also leaves out the trailing
'+' as check indicator: In Shogi such a trailing '+' means promotion,
while a trailing '=' means defer promotion. Prefix '+' signs are used
on moves with promoted pieces, disambiguation is done western SAN
style.

/allWhite=FALSE
Causes the outline of the 'white' pieces to be superimposed onto the
'black' piece symbols as well (as a black outline) when native bitmaps
are used (as opposed to font-based rendering). This is useful if we
choose a very light color to represent the 'black' pieces. It might be
particularly useful in Shogi, where the conventional representation of
the 'black' pieces is as upside-down white pieces, so that both colors
would be white. This option is saved in the winboard.ini file, and can
be set in the "Options -> Board..." sub-menu.

/flipBlack=FALSE
This option is reserved for future use. It will cause upside-down
display of the 'black' native piece bitmaps, as would be needed for
Shogi. For now it can be set from the "Options -> Board..." sub-menu,
and it is saved in the winboard.ini file, but it is ignored.

/detectMate=TRUE
/testClaim=TRUE
/materialDraws=TRUE
/trivialDraws=FALSE
/ruleMoves=51
/repeatsToDraw=6
These are all options that only affect engine-engine play, and can be
set from the "Options -> Engine..." sub-menu. They are all related to
adjudication of games by the GUI. Legality checking must be switched
on for them to work.  If /detectMate is TRUE, the GUI recognizes
checkmate and stalemate (but not in games with holdings!), and ends
the game accordingly before the engines can claim. This is convenient
for play with engines that fail to claim, and just exit.  With
/testClaim set, all result and illegal-move claims by engines that
claim more than their own loss are scrutinized for validity, and false
claims result in forfeit of the game. Useful with buggy engines.  The
option /materialDraws=TRUE causes games with insufficient mating
material to be adjudicated immediately as draws, in case the engines
would not claim them.  The option /trivialDraws adjudicates KNNK,
KBKB, KNKN, KBKN, KRKR and KQKQ to draws after 3 moves (to allow for a
quick tactical win. Note that in KQKQ this might not be sound, but
that problem would disappear once bitbase probing is added).  The
/ruleMoves determine after how many reversible moves the game is
adjudicated as a draw. Setting this to 0 turns this option off. Draw
claims by the engine are still accepted (by /testClaim) after 50
reversible moves, even if /ruleMoves species a larger number. Note
that it is perfectly legal according to FIDE rules to play on after 50
reversible moves, but in tournaments having two engines that want to
play on forever is a nuisance in endings like KBNKR, where one of the
engines thinks it is ahead and can avoids repeats virtually forever.
The option /repeatsToDraw makes the GUI adjudicate a game as draw
after the same position has occurred the specified number of times. If
it is set to a value > 3, engines can still claim the draw after
3-fold repeat.  All these options are saved in the winboard.ini file.

Clocks
There is an "Options -> flip Clocks" command, that swaps the position
of white and black clocks (convenient in over-the-board matches, where
the screen is next to the board, and you want your own time to be
displayed on your side of the screen). The clocks can be adjusted in
"edit game" mode: right-clicking them adds one minute, left-clicking
subtracts one minute. (Also for OTB matches, to keep them synchronized
with the official match clock.) The flag-fell condition is now
indicated as (!) behind the time.

Other improvements
Castling rights and e.p. rights are now fully maintained, and
considered in legality testing. They are imported from and written to
FEN, as is the 50-move counter.

** Winboard_F 4.3.2

These are the release notes of Winboard_F 4.3.2, which is released
under the GPL.  This version was derived from Allessandro Scotti's
Winboard_x 4.2.7 source files.  It only includes the files that were
changed:

config.h
common.h
parser.h
moves.h
resource.h

winboard.c
backend.c
moves.c

parser.l
winboard.rc

and some bitmaps for piece symbols

I made modifications in the following areas:

1) Adjudication and claim verification
2) Fairy pieces and board sizes other than 8x8
3) Miscellaneous

Miscellaneous

/matchPause=10000
is an option to set the length of the pause between two games of a
match. The value is in msec, default value is 10000 (I will present
all newly implemented options with their default value as example). Be
aware that some engines might not be stopped yet if you make the pause
too small, but might still be puking output, which then will interfere
with the next game. But the fixed value of 10 sec of the old Winboard
seemed like overdoing it.

Time info in PGN
When you ask for the PV-info to be stored in the PGN (a Winboard_x
option), it now also stores the time spent on the move with it.

Flag fell
In engine-engine games the messge "white/black/both" flag(s) fell" no
longer appears in the window caption, but as an exclamation point
behind the clock time. (To prevent the annoying overwriting of the
normal header line).

Adjudications and Claim verification.

These functions are only present in engine-engine games, and only if
legality-testing is switched on. (The latter will be typically
switched off in games with bizarre rules, which the GUI doesn't know,
and in that case the GUI can never have an opinion on the outcome of a
game.)

Illegal-move forfeit
As soon as one of the engines plays an illegal move, it forfeits the
game. This feature was already present, but it should be 100% reliable
now, as it also takes e.p. and castling rights into account, rather
than erring on the safe side.

Illegal-move claim
From the above, it follows that any illegal-move claims by an engine
must be false, and will result in forfeiting the game. (In Winboard_x
this message is ignored, causing the game or match to hang.)

Checkmate adjudication
As soon as one of the engines does a move that results in checkmate,
the GUI declares the game won, without waiting for the engine to claim
it.

Insufficient mating material
As soon as the material on the board has shrunk to KK, KNK or KBK, the
game is declared draw.

/adjudicateLossThreshold=0
This option was already present in Winboard_x, (to declare a game lost
for which both engines agree for 3 moves that the score is below the
given threshold), but a non-zero value is now also used to enable the
following adjudications. If you only want the latter, just make the
threshold impossibly low (-40000 will usually do the trick).

Trivial draws
If we are 3 moves into a KQKQ, KRKR, KBKB KBKN or KNKN end-game, the
game is adjudicated as draw.

/repeatsToDraw=6
When the specified number of repeats occurs, the game is adjudicated
draw. Should keep track of e.p. and castling rights. This does not
require legality-testing to be switched on. The engines retain the
legal right to claim after a 3-fold repetition, though. If you set
this parameter to 3 or less, they will never get the chance. Better
not set it to 1 or less.

/ruleMoves=51
After the given number of full moves without capture or Pawn move, the
game is adjudicated draw. Even without legality testing. The engines
retain the legal right to claim after 50 moves.

/testClaims=FALSE
When enabled, this option verifies all result claims made by the
engines, and overrules the claim if it is false (forfeiting the game
for the claimer). An engine can still safely claim a win for its
opponent on a nonsense reason, though; this is taken to be the
equivalent of 'resign'. Draw claims (made before a draw adjudication)
are checked against the 50-move, 3-fold-repetition or
insufficient-material rules. Win claims are always considered false,
as the GUI adjudicates checkmates (and stalemates) before any engine
can claim them.

Fairy-Chess support

/boardWidth=8
Sets the number of files on the board. The additional files are named
i, j, k, l... in PGN, and should be indicated this way in
communicating moves to and from the engine. Currently works upto
12. No guarantees on how the rest of the display (clocks, etc.) looks
if you make this number < 8.

/boardHeight=8
Sets the number of ranks. Extra ranks are numbered 9, 10, 11... in
PGN. This is so far largely untested, and unlikely to work for
double-digit ranks. Displaying boards with upto 12 ranks seems to
work, though, but double-digit ranks might cause all kind of unforseen
problems in PGN file and move parser, or in communication with the
engine. To avoid such problems as much as possible, in boards with
more than 9 ranks the counting of ranks will start at zero rather than
one!

/fontPieceToCharTable="......."
This paramater, controlling the mapping of font symbols to piece
types, was already present in Winboard_x. The default is dependent on
the font selected with the /renderPiecesWithFont option. It can now
accept upto 32 pieces, but the length should always be even. The first
half designates the white pieces, the second half the black, both in
the order PNBRACHFEWDOGMQK. (The letters mentioned here are the
letters by which the pieces will be indicated in PGN and FEN notation,
what you have to give as argument depends on the font you use. A black
king might be 'l', for instance).  If you give fewer then 32 pieces,
this will go at the expense of what is just before Queen. So the last
two symbols you give for each color are always Queen and King, the
others are assigned in the order Pawn, Knight, ... Pieces that do not
get a symbol assigned will remain invisible.

fairy-FEN support
The letters ACDEFGHMOW are accepted in FENs in addition to the regular
PNBRQK,(and of course the lower case versions for black), and are
passed to the engine in a setboard or edit menu.  Double-digit skips
are acceptable in FENs. 'x' is interpreted as a skip of 10.  Castling
rights should no longer be ignored. (Doesn't work for FRC yet,
though.)  The 50-move-plies field should also be meaningful now.

Legality testing for Fairy pieces
There is a build in notion of what some of the new pieces can do, according to
A = Archbishop (aka Cardinal) = N+B
C = Chancellor (aka Marshall) = N+R
F = Ferz (aka General), moves 1 step diagonal
W = Wazir (aka Grand Vizer), moves 1 step orthogonal
E = Elephant (aka Alfil), jumps 2 steps diagonal
D = Dabbabah (aka War Machine), jumps 2 steps orthogonal
M = Man (aka Commoner), moves as King, but is not a royal piece
O = Cannon, moves along Rook lines, but cannot capture unless it jumps over
            exactly one piece (friend or foe), and captures the first piece
            it encounters thereafter. It can only jump if it captures something.
            The piece jumped over (the 'platform') is not affected.
The other pieces have not yet any moves implemented:
H = Nightrider
G = Grasshopper
In games that use the mentioned pieces as described (Shatranj,
Courier, Capablanca Chess) you can leave legality testing on. If you
use them to represent pieces that move differently, you should switch
legality testing off.

Pawn moves
Pawn motion is made dependent on the variant played: in Shatranj and
Courier the double move is forbidden. In those games promotions are
always to Ferz. In Capablanca Chess the ArchBishop and Chancellor also
appear as choices in the promotion popup box.


/variant="normal"
Several new variants names are added (replacing "variant31" upto
"variant36"). They affect the initial position. (Board size has to be
set separately.) They are: courier (a Medieval predecessor of modern
Chess, played on a 12x8 board) capablanca (on a 10x8 board, featuring
Archbishop and Chancellor) gothic (as Capablanca, but with a more
exciting initial setup) xiangqi (Chinese Chess) shogi (Japanese Chess,
no support yet) fairy (This variant plays on 8x8 with HEW in stead of
NBR on the Queen side, so that all back-rank pieces are (potentially)
different) Make sure the selected board size matches the variant; this
is not automatic

Xiangqi and Shogi support (or lack thereof)
Xiangqi is only partially supported. The board display is
western-style (the pieces play on squares, rather than grid
intersections). The legality testing uses the Shatranj Knight and
Elephant, that cannot be blocked, and thus allows some moves that
should be illegal in Xiangqi. The Palace region is indicated on the
board, but there is no testing if the King or Mandarins (implemented
as ordinary Ferzes) leave the Palace. SAN might be non-standard, as it
uses O to indicate Cannon. Most of this will be fixed in a future
version.  Shogi is not yet supported at all, first the shaky
implementation of Crazyhouse will have to be beefed up.
