See ../bitmaps/README.  These pixmaps were converted from the bitmaps there,
and the same notices apply.

[HGM] The non-orthodox pieces were converted from ../winboard/bitmaps/*.bmp,
by the program 'convert.c' in this folder. If you like the WinBoard pieces
better than the traditional xboard bitmaps, you could run that program again
to convert the orthodox pieces from their WinBoard bitmaps, and overwrite
the xboard pixmaps with them.
