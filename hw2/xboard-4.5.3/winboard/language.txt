## WinBoard language file

## LANGUAGE NAME IN ENGLISH / TRANSLATED
## v1.0 beta 1
##
## Translation by NAME (DATE)
## SAME AS ABOVE, TRANSLATED
## WEB ADDRESS OF TRANSLATOR
##
## If you revise this, please insert your date, name and description.
## TRANSLATION OF MESSAGE ABOVE
##
## For example:
## TRANSLATION OF FOR EXAMPLE
##   24-ago-2010. Juan Pérez (j@xyz.p). Corrected translation for xyzzy.

## Notes for translators (can be deleted from he file after translation):
##   Just write the translations between the second pair of quotes
##   Things like %s, %d and %c must be preserved in the original order
##   Empty translated strings will be ignored, so there is no reason
##   to delete those for which you don't know a translation,
##   and you can start testing everything immediately.
##   Simply rename this file to LANGUAGE.lng, and WinBoard should see it,
##   and allow you to use the option /language=LANGUAGE.
##   You are encouraged to call up the corresponding WinBoard dialog while
##   working on the translation, to see in which context the strings are used.
##   This is why the strings below are sorted by dialog
##
##   Of duplicats, only the first occurrence will be used, even if it was in
##   a different dialog! For this reason you will only see an 'OK' in the
##   About Box. After you translated it there, this translation will be used
##   for all other dialogs as well.
## o Use ## for comments, to make iteasy to find them scattered throughout the translation
## o Careful with temptation of direct translation, by example 'movimiento' for 'move' when 'jugada' is better.
## o Try to use short phrases, more text doesn't imply more clearness.
## o Check that your translation is right, does it mean what it does?
## o Test your translation, check every dialog.
## o For standard chess names check Wikipedia for confirmation.
## o For menus, assign shortcuts (character &) until you finish the translation.
##   preferably it should be unique in the applicable menu, so it depends on translation of other items!

winboard.rc

MENUS:
## Pleace keep the accelerator-key indications on the menu items, and keep 
## the keystrokes the same (for now). (Alt, Ctrl and Shift can be translated.)
